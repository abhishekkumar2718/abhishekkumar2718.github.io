# GSoC '20

I was selected as one of the Google Summer of Code students for Git in
2020, working to [Implement Generation Number v2](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/4722049416691712/#6140278689234944). You can find code on [my repository](https://github.com/abhishekkumar2718/GSoC20).
