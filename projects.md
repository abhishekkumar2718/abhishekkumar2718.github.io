I am Abhishek Kumar, Bachelor of Technology, Computer Science And Engineering  (2022 Batch) from [National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal](https://www.nitk.ac.in/).

I specialise in web development, as a backend developer. I am proficient in, and have a preference for Ruby on Rails but have worked with Django as well.

I admire the Open Source Philosophy and am an avid user of Linux. I am a console-addict and look to automate my workflow. _I use Arch, btw._

I am exploring Artificial Intelligence in my free time. I relish taking new challenges and figuring things on my own, _much to the detriment of my mentors_.

My fellow programmers describe me as someone obsessed with coding conventions and documentation. _This might be a reason I prefer working alone._

[Here's a generic resume](/assets/resume.pdf) (_might be outdated_).
