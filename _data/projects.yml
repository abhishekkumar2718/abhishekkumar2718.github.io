    DebianCI is an automated system that coordinates the execution of automated 
    tests against packages in the Debian system.<br/><br/> 
    I have been contributing since March 2019, as a part of GSoC although I couldn't be selected. 
    Debci was my first experience with a _professional_ standard codebase.
    I have learned a lot about coding conventions and standards.
    Contributing to Debci helped me improve my ruby skills.

    I have worked primarily on Admissions, Ph.D. and Certificates modules.
    I am proud of my work at IRIS, and it's gratifying to see my contributions make life easier for people at NITK.

    Dotfiles are plain text configuration files. The name derives from the leading `.` in their names, making them hidden.<br/><br/>
    I have spent a lot of time configuring and adjusting my desktop. 
    Setting up a new VM or even desktops is difficult and error-prone. 
    In true Linux tradition, I made a few helper scripts to automate the proccess.

- NoteTaker:
  name: NoteTaker
  status: In Progress
  link: https://github.com/abhishekkumar2718/NoteTaker
  technologies:
    - Ruby
    - Markdown
  description: |
    NoteTaker is a barebones notes-taking app which renders a nested markdown directory to HTML. 

    I had the idea for this project as I couldn't find any markdown-based note taking solution which works well with Vim.
    I had some experience with Jekyll, which lays a lot of groundwork for this project.
