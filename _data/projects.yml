    DebianCI is an automated system that coordinates the execution of automated 
    tests against packages in the Debian system.<br/><br/> 
    I have been contributing since March 2019, as a part of GSoC although I couldn't be selected. 
    Debci was my first experience with a _professional_ standard codebase.
    I have learned a lot about coding conventions and standards.
    Contributing to Debci helped me improve my ruby skills.

    IRIS is a home-grown ERP solution for administrative, academic, and alumni-related needs of NITK. 
    It was founded by a group of students envisioning to bring a change at NITK under the guidance of Dr. KV Gandadharan.<br/><br/>
    I have been working as a backend developer since January 2019, after a winter internship in December 2018.
    I have worked primarily on Admissions, Ph.D. and Certificates modules.
    I am proud of my work at IRIS, and it's gratifying to see my contributions make life easier for people at NITK.

  description: |
    A blockchain based voting application for NITK community.<br/><br/>
    I have worked over this project with Harsh Agrawal and Krishna Swaroop during the ACM-IE Digital Hackathon in 2019.
    We hope our application will be integrated with the actual class representative and committee elections soon.
    It was my first experience, managing a collaborative project and the 24-hour timeframe of the hackathon made it
    a challenging experience.

- Dotfiles:
  name: Dotfiles
  status: Finished
  repo_link: https://github.com/abhishekkumar2718/dotfiles
  technologies: Shell Scripting, Linux
  description: |
    Dotfiles are plain text configuration files. The name derives from the leading `.` in their names, making them hidden.<br/><br/>
    I have spent a lot of time configuring and adjusting my desktop. 
    Setting up a new VM or even desktops is difficult and error-prone. 
    In true Linux tradition, I made a few helper scripts to automate the proccess.

- NoteTaker:
  name: NoteTaker
  status: In Progress
  repo_link: https://github.com/abhishekkumar2718/NoteTaker
  technologies: Ruby, Markdown
  description: |
    NoteTaker is a barebones notes-taking app which renders a nested markdown directory to HTML. 

    I had the idea for this project as I couldn't find any markdown-based note taking solution which works well with Vim.
    I had some experience with Jekyll, which lays a lot of groundwork for this project.
