  about: My collection of dotfiles which heavily customize the experience.

    Dotfiles are plain text configuration files. The name derives from the leading `.` in their names, making them hidden.<br/><br/>
    I have spent a lot of time configuring and adjusting my desktop. 
    Setting up a new VM or even desktops is difficult and error-prone. 
    In true Linux tradition, I made a few helper scripts to automate the proccess.

  technologies: Ruby, Markdown

  about: NoteTaker is a barebones notes-taking app which renders a nested markdown directory to HTML.

    I had the idea for this project as I couldn't find any markdown-based note taking solution which work well with Vim.
    I had some experience with Jekyll, which lays a lot of groundwork for this project.
