title: A (Possibly) Better Way to Teach

excerpt: I will think of something cool to say

About a year ago, [I criticized the way SMPs and other learning
initiatives teach](/).  

With the IRIS RoR Bootcamp coming up, it's time to put money where my
mouth is and come up with a better solution. While I primarily write for
IRIS RoR Bootcamp (as I have some influence over the process), it can be
generalized to most forms of "community" learning - college clubs, hobby
organizations and self-learning groups.

## Principles

I believe a **good** theory must necessarily derive from self-evident
principles. I have arranged the principles in the order of specificity:
from least specific (i.e. applicable to most scenarios) to most
specific.

### Practice Deliberately

### Train for Self-Learning

### Use Extrinsic Motivation

### Gamify Learning

### Play to Strengths of the medium

## The Plan

With the overarching principles in place, here's how I would organize a
learning initiative:

If the plan feels oddly similar to how competitive programming is set up,
it is no accident - CP platforms have figured out the process by trial
and error.

The plan, however makes a drastically different set of assumptions than
typical SMP:
- Requires greater investment from "teacher" in form of preparing
  assignments and providing feedback.
- Requires greater investment from "student" in form of active
  practice and self-learning rather than passively attending lectures.
- For skills without automated testing, individualized feedback for each
  student might not be feasible.

While the plan might end up with fewer students sticking and completing
the course, the quality of work produced will be _impressively better_.

Fewer but better developers is an acceptable tradeoff for IRIS.

## Conclusion

- Princples for My Design
  - Introduction
  - Reward System:
    - Influence
  - Gamification:
    - Irresistible, Chapter 12
- My Design:
  - Use existing resources (don't reinvent the wheel)
  - Use assignments instead of online classes
  - Build up to the project
  - Introduce a ranking system, with incentives
  - Reference competitive programming as a similar, successful project
