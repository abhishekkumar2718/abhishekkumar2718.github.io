> Congralutions on being the first reader interested to learn about me!

Hello, again. I am Abhishek.

_I am just a guy who writes for fun._

**Here's the extended backstory**

By the end of first year, I felt my life was getting too one-dimensional. I would spend all my time locked up in my room, working on some project. For an idea about howbad my situation was, I had skipped most of the cultural fest working on something I don't even remember now.

My friends would ask, _"What did you do over the weekend?"_. I would never have an interesting answer. I could feel them regretting even asking, for they knew answer.

Over the summer, I was determined to change this. I signed up for ACM's literary SMPs. I started running three days a week. I even gave up _Netflix and Chill_, replacing it with some _Neruda and Ball Dancing_. (Sounds fancy, doesn't it?)

And I started this blog.

The blog is the centerpiece of all my different pursuits. 

You might read a article on _The Mistakes I Made In GSoC Proposal_, followed by a higly controversial article on _Why One Punch Man Is My New Favorite Show_ finishing it off with some motivational _A Guide to Intermittent Fasting: Turns Out Skipping Mess Food Is A New Fad_.

I will be adding articles every once in a while.

> That was a lot about me! Drop by and say hello. Trust me, I have much more to talk about.
