<h4><p class="text-primary">About Me</p></h4>
Hello! I see you have found the way to my personal website.

Welcome to <strong>Ramblings</strong>, where I write about anything that interests me.

I am <span class="text-primary">Abhishek Kumar</span>, a student of NITK, CSE 2022. That's all I am going to bother you with my academic life.

I have been always fascinated with the people's behavior and culture. I feel the need to analyse from the viewpoint of someone who is socially inept.

I have been broadening my interests since a while and looking to get back into habit of reading. I write shitty literature too!

I have planned quite a few articles. Visit the site regularly.

<p class="text-muted">Pssh... If you are a recruiter looking to hire me, take a look at <a href="{{ site.projects_index }}">my projects</a> or my <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.social_links.github }}">github profile.</a></p>
