# Lessons from Ruby on Rails Bootcamp
{:.no_toc}

Over January and February, I had the fortune of leading
the [IRIS Ruby on Rails bootcamp](https://github.com/IRIS-NITK/IRIS-RoR-Bootcamp-2020).
It has been a rewarding experience for me, both personally and learning
more about Rails.

Given my criticism of earlier editions of Bootcamp, it's only fair to
measure my outing with the same metrics. I have written down my lessons from
the process and some experiments with the Bootcamp format.

## Context

Before getting down to the statistics, it's important to note that this
year's Bootcamp was markedly different from earlier editions because:

The first years were admitted to college in _decemeber_! We
had to shift the Bootcamp to January, where it was conducted alongside
college classes. They were also less experienced than before - from
installing Linux (Linux Installations drives are no longer possible),
using Git (Hacktober fest serves as an initiation to Git and Github) and
programming constructs (we could no longer rely on C programming course
to cover concepts like variables, functions).

Of course, all is not lost - thanks to Announcements module, we had a
far greater reach than earlier editions (a total of 515 participants
registered for RoR and Flutter Bootcamps). As the Bootcamp was first
major "non-academic" event, the first years were eager to learn new
things and prove their mettle.

## Demographics

Thanks to the Forms module, we have the unique opportunity to dissect
the participant demographics. Of course, not everyone who registers for
the Bootcamp takes an active role - take this with a grain of salt.

- 398 Participants registered to learn Ruby on Rails.

- Breakdown of participants by year:

| Batch | Number of Participants |
| ----- | ---------------------- |
| 2016  | 1   |
| 2017  | 30  |
| 2018  | 33  |
| 2019  | 105 |
| 2020  | 229 |

Interestingly, I didn't expect so many participants in their third and
final years. I had also hoped for greater participation from second
years, but you can't _have everything_.

- Breakdown by participants by program type:

| Programme | Number of Participants |
| --------- | ---------------------- |
| B. Tech   | 337 |
| M. Tech   | 41  |
| Others    | 20  |

Participants are predominately B.Tech, although it's nice to see some
participation from post-graduate courses.

- Breakdown of participants by department (top five):

| Department | Number of Participants |
| ------ | ---------------------- |
| Computer Science and Engineering | 80 |
| Information Technology | 71 |
| Electronics and Communication Engineering | 69 |
| Mechanical Engineering Engineering | 58 |
| Electrical and Electronics Engineering | 29 |
| Others | 91 |

The fourth most branch has _twice_ the participants in the fifth most
branch. We might increase participation dramatically if we reach out to
"less interested" branches.

- We asked the participants their preferred methods of learning:

| Type | Number of Participants who prefer this type |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Video Tutorials | 334 |
| Assignments and Projects | 294 |
| Interactive Sessions | 235 |
| Books and Documentation | 233 |

Sad to see "Books and Documentation" is the least preferred way to
learn.

- We asked participants to quantify their commitment to Bootcamp (in
hours per week):

| Number of Hours | Number of Participants |
| --------------- | ---------------------- |
| < 2 hours   | 24  |
| 2 - 4 hours | 158 |
| 4 - 6 hours | 117 |
| 6 - 8 hours | 70  |
| > 8 hours   | 29  |

Between two sessions per week (close to three hours), it might have been
hard for participants unwilling to commit more hours to engage with the
Bootcamp effectively.

## Statistics

### Sessions Attendance

| Session | Number of Live Participants  | Microsoft Stream Views |
| ------- | ---------------------------  | ---------------------- |
| Session 1 - Getting Started with Rails | 179 | 121 |
| Session 2 - Models                     | 59  | 41 |
| Session 3 - Controllers                | 31  | 25 |
| Session 4 - Views                      | 14  | 12 |

### Assignment Submissions

| Assignment | Submissions |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Session 0 - Ruby | 10 |
| Session 1 - Getting Started with Rails | 27 |
| Session 2 - Models | 11 |
| Session 3 - Controllers | 8 |
| Session 4 - Views | 8 |
| Session 5 - Associations and Validation | 3 |

> The number of submissions for Session 4 is artificially inflated as
> it was chosen as the qualifying criteria for Bootcamp interviews.

The numbers paint the same picture as any earlier edition of Bootcamp,
participation gradually decays away - leaving behind a small core of
dedicated learners.

However, I would like to make the case that _any_ assignment submission
improved over the earlier Bootcamps. Programming is a skill,
and skills require practice - each submission represents some time spent
practicing.

## Lessons

### Don't take it personally

It's hard to not the decline in participation personally - after all,
it feels many students _indepdendently_ decide you are boring and what
you teach is unimportant. However, people often drop out because of
mundane, unrelated reasons - it's sticking with the Bootcamp that's
exceptional.

In any case, I have found it useful to move from uncontrollable
variables (number of participants, number of submissions) to
controllable variables - time spent preparing the sessions, code reviews
and others.

### Plan out the complete Bootcamp

While I had the general outline of "MVC, then M, then C and finally V"
for the syllabus, I could have better planned out the later
sessions of the Bootcamp in greater detail - especially the assignments
and content. It was crucial, as the breakneck pace of
"two sessions per week" was far too much for me to handle, and later
sessions dipped in quality and insight.

### Don't break the momentum

Talking of pace, I had a difficult decision to make after the first
session. As some participants were unable to install Rails, I could have
delayed the second session and spent the weekend helping them out.
Or, I could go ahead with the second session as planned.

In hindsight, I should have gone ahead with the second session - less
than five participants bothered to show up for the installation and the
week-and-half break, the sessions were far too long to retain
participant's interest.

### Involve more people in the process

Between the preparing content, taking sessions, and reviewing submissions -
I was spread too thin by the second half of Bootcamp. I could have
involved more people in the process, taking their help in the sessions, mainly as I taught too fast and tried to cover too many things.

I rejected and rewrote the second and third sessions' drafts because
they were not in "my style". "My style" was just _one_ of the ways to
approach the topics. I could have spent my time mentoring and molding
the drafts instead.

### Have faith in people

When there are two groups of people, it's often implicitly viewed as an
_adversial relation_. It's open to question whether surprise tests have
any value apart from preying on unprepared students.

Likewise, I too started to view the participants through an adversarial
lens - if I don't teach it, they will not learn it. The third session
stretched an hour-long, and I still had authorization to cover.

However, my fears were unfounded as the participants have gone beyond
the minimum requirements in the fourth session - learning to render
PDFs, using toasts and carousels on their own!

## Future Experiments

### Smaller, more frequent sessions

Halfway across the Bootcamp, I came across
[RailsCasts](http://railscasts.com/) - which takes on a small facet of
web development on Rails in 20-30 minute screencast. A similar format
might work for intermediate topics like authentication, authorization,
using Bootstrap, and others.

### Web Manager != Good teacher

While web managers have traditionally taught Bootcamp, I
see no good reason why it has to be the case. I struggle with explaining
complicated topics and am generally not a good public speaker, so why
not let someone who is better-suited handle the job.

### A Different Course Outline

While MVC is a great framework to organize the sessions conceptually,
it's hard to appreciate their utility as a novice.

Alternatively, we could follow [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails)'s
lead on the order with approaching routing, controllers and views first
followed by models. Participants gain confidence with building something
immediately useful and demonstrable.
